            <p>Caracas it's a beautiful place capital of the country that for me once was the best place on earth during those years when I was a kid with my parents, majestic mountains, perfect weather, full of cultural traditions from the music, dance to even birthdays and the birthplace of the energetic, funny, and lovely people that I have ever met.</p>
